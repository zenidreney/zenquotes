# Zen Quotes app

This is a learning project forked from Scrimba Front-End Developer Path.
The original was a message posting app mock-up.

I stretched it to have reply button working with its delete buttons.
I have also learned the localStorage with this project.

Also note that the feed is rendered by DOM API instead of string-based HTML injection.
